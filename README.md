# Recursion Mastery
 Practicing any recursion problem, I come across.

This is to record of my journey to become a software developer. 

palindromepattern.py - Checks if substrings in a word are palindromes. 

palindromenumber.py - Given an integer, write a function that returns true if the given number is palindrome, else false.

equalsumofbinarysequence.py - Given a number n, find all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
